                <h1> OUR HISTORY   </h1>
                <p id="text-a"> Founded in 1957, The Honest Herb is a purveyor of the finest spices, herbs, blends, and extracts to customers ranging from renowned Michelin-star chefs to home cooks everywhere.  We’ve spent over 60 years curating our global network of premium growers and distributors in order to offer our customers unrivaled quality and selection. Our products range from essential and rare spice varietals to proprietary rubs and blends. We share with our customers a passion for crafting delicious dishes from scratch, discovering and experimenting with new tastes, and gathering with loved ones to enjoy a well-cooked meal. Fresh, quality spices empower us to transform simple ingredients into delicious, flavorful meals. From the pungent heat of a chile pepper, to the delicate bouquet of paprika blooming in the pan, the right spice makes the dish. Every spice has an origin story—one that can be traced back to a corner of the world with a particular ecology and anthropology that informs how we use that spice today.  We honor these origins by sourcing our spices from the most experienced, high-quality suppliers in those regions and by passing our knowledge of spices on to our customers.  </p>
